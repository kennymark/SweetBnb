We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments. I hope you enjoy the experience and adventure and thank you in advance :).\r\n\r\nYour hosts,\r\nWillian - Fabio", "guests_included": 4, "host_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/21083998", "host_id": "21083998", "availability_30": 30, "host_total_listings_count": 49, "neighbourhood": "Isle of Dogs", "calculated_host_listings_count": 45, "interaction": "Please inquire to find out more and feel free to ask us any questions and let us know of any special requirements that you may have.

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world.

Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years.

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world.

He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years.

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world.

We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years.

Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years.

He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years.

An Ecuadorian by birth, He has added to my higher education internationally, with economic studies in the USA, language training in Japan, and a BA and MBA in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am a 37 year old professional, currently working and living in London, Willian is 30 year old professional, currently working and living in lively London. the most exciting and bigger property market in the world. During all this description of myself well mostly Willian, you will find out how travelling could probably be Willian's and I number 1 hobbie. Although, We do not see it as a hobby but a luxury :). We do also enjoy playing sports, attending concerts, going to the movies, clubbing, hanging out, cooking and much more! \r\n\r\nAirbnb is awesome. Willian remembers his first time using the portal was back in 2010, when he travelled to Tokyo to attend an university interview over there. He had booked an comfortable duplex apartment in Shinjuku from this lovely Japanese guy, Junichi. He was amazed to see the true meaning of hospitality, being a host is more than just being the doorman or the typical receptionist at concierge, it is being someone who receives, treat and entertains other people as guests. \r\n\r\nAll my life Willian and I have dedicated quite a lot of time to travel around the globe where We have had the opportunity to meet amazing people and experienced other cultures, costumes, and more. That is exactly why I am currently working in the hospitality industry with my colleague and friend Fabio because what I have learned all these years travelling around is that hospitality is the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers not matter where people come from.\r\n\r\nFabio and I look forward welcoming and hosting some many guest in the upcoming years. I will truly give you my 100% to ensure your stay goes very well why you are staying at my apartments.
